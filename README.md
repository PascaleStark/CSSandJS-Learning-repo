# MyLearningRepo

In this repo, I have included some of the learning projects that were built in the context of the two courses:

- [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.
- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.
