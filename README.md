# JS projects

In this repo, I have included three CSS projects that were built in the context of the complete JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann: [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.. In all projects, I use SASS preprocessor that is compiled to CSS using the node-sass npm package (see package.json file).

- First Project: **Mapty** - Practice Object Oriented Programming (OOP) as well as using the Geolocation API, displaying a map using the leaflet library, etc. 

- Second Project: **Bankist** - Practice working with arrays and array methods such as forEach, map, filter, and reduce.

- Thrid Project: **Forkify** - Practice all learned concepts in JavaScript including building an MVC architecture that relies on the concept of prototypal inheritance to better organize and maitain the code, using ES6+ features like ES6 modules and protected and private data, etc.
