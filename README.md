# JS projects

In this repo, I have included three JS projects that were built in the context of the complete JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann: [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

- First Project: **Mapty** - Practice Object Oriented Programming (OOP) as well as using the Geolocation API, displaying a map using the leaflet library, etc. 
 
- Second Project: **Bankist** - Practice working with arrays and array methods such as forEach, map, filter, and reduce.

- Thrid Project: **Forkify** - Practice all learned concepts in JavaScript including building an MVC architecture that relies on the concept of prototypal inheritance to better organize and maitain the code, using ES6+ features like ES6 modules and protected and private data, etc. 

# Setup

- From the command line, clone the repo.

- Choose the project that you would like to view.

- To open the project in a live server, use the command ```live-server``` (install live server [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)).

NOTE: For the forkify project, you will need to download all dependencies required for this project use ```npm install``` before starting up the project on a live-server. 

# How to use 

- Mapty: Allow the browser to get your location. When the map loads, click on the screen to open the form.
- Bankist: Login using the username 'js' and password '111' to make transactions.
